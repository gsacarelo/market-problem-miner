      "text": "I am kind of like this with Bleu de Chanel EDP, I’ve continued to buy it time and time again every couple of years but cannot get anything cheaper that is “exactly” a 1 to 1 of BDC.Davidoff, Lacoste, Diesel and so on are probably as cheap as you’ll find any sort of designer fragrance today.Middle Eastern brands I don’t mind but it entirely depends on the scent profile as a lot of Middle Eastern produced fragrances are not going to appeal to the mass European markets taste unless of course there replicating mainstream designer fragrances, case in point I got on the Tiktok hype about Nocturno by Rayhaan, thats me decided I’ll never go near a Dior Sauvage again, aside from the Elixir, subsequently I purchased Valhalla by Rayhaan and immediately liked how unique it was therefore their is really no need for me to consider anything else.I will say that I think Middle Eastern brands are slaying it just now and ultimately if price meets the consumers expectations of how much it should cost not what firm simply want you to pay, they’ll get increased sales, I’m guessing it’s also a similar thing to the way Chinese cars are all over Europe now.",

      "text": "I mean shit as long as I’ve always known that stuff is expensive. I used to not even buy cologne at all because of how high it is . I get I came to do research on dupes and budget friendly gems I found a lot more success and now I have a small beginners collection. But it’s one that I think it’s pretty good . I’ve got just about every scent you can think of . And it took me 100 dollars less to get about 20 different bottles. To me that sounds like a way better deal than spending almost 300 dollars for 1 bottle . Idc how much money you make in life . Me personally I’ll never pay 300 dollars just to have a nice smell as I walk around 🤷🏾‍♂️. I mean maybe a nice bottle or two in your collection is nice . But man you guys must be rich . To have a full collection of these expensive ass bottles of cologne is truly remarkable 😂😅",
