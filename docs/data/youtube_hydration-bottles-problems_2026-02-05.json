      "text": "I’ve had my regular Owala for 2.5 years and use it daily and although it has some minor scuffs and small dents, it works perfectly and keeps my water cold. It’s super easy to clean as long as you have a straw cleaner. Mine has never leaked and I’ve dropped it many times on concrete.",

      "text": "Great analysis.  Would you please review Iron Flask (I like it for my iced tea) and Reduce, which I  drink water from. I enjoy both.  I have had two different Tal water bottles.  The straw stopped working in the first,  even after I took it all apart.  The second one,  the handle on the side came loose at the upper connection. It was not a screw attachment.  I glued it back on and is working for now. But I  think I&#39;m  done buying the Tal brand. Thanks for all your hard work!",

      "text": "Hey man, the shape of the bottle opening has more to do with temperature retention than the brand. You put cups, bottles, wide mouths, &amp; skinny tops in the same competition. The smaller the opening, the better it is at retention but the harder it is to clean. You should test which bottle strikes the perfect balance.",
